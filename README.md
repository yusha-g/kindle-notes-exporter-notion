# Kindle Notes Exporter to Notion
Exports kindle highlights and notes to Notion pages. 
Currently converts `My Clippings.txt` to `.md` file compressed in `.zip`, which needs to then be imported into Notion manually.

### Known drawbacks
- .md does not support Database of pages.

### Future plans 
- try `html` export instead of `.md`
